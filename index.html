                    Rabbits are small, furry mammals with long ears, short fluffy tails, and strong, large hind legs. They have 2 pairs of sharp incisors (front teeth), one pair on top and one pair on the bottom. They also have 2 peg teeth behind the top incisors. Rabbits enjoy being around people and can usually recognise their owners by sight and sound. But because they're prey animals, they prefer to have all four feet firmly on the ground. That being said they can make wonderful pets and can even be trained...

                    They are one of the cleanliest animals and are much more selective feeders than cows, sheep, pigs, and even swine. Goats are very intelligent and curious animals.They are very picky eaters. They have very sensitive lips, which they use to “mouth” things in search of clean and tasty food. They will often refuse to eat hay. Goats were one of the first animals to be tamed by humans and were being herded 9,000 years ago, they can be taught their name and to come when called. The life span of a goat is about that of a dog...

                    After dogs, cats and fish, birds are America’s fourth favorite pet. An estimated 14 million birds live in captivity across the United States, a great many of them parrots. And no wonder: With their captivating colors, acrobatic antics and often silly personalities, these avian characters are hard to resist. Pet parrots can be incredible if demanding friends, but for people more accustomed to fluffy mammalian companions, they can present some unexpected challenges. The long-lived, intelligent and highly social birds need especially high amounts of attention and enrichment, or else they can pick up bad habits and find themselves bored and stressed to the point where they pluck out their own feathers.

                  <p class="card-text text-success mt-5">
                    Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness. Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their length. Playing regularly with a cat and providing their entertaining toys can easily satisfy their stalking instinct, keep them stimulated and provide the exercise they need to stay healthy and happy. It also keeps local wildlife safe! Kittens meow to let their mother know they're cold or hungry, but once they get a bit older, cats no longer meow to other cats.
