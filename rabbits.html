                </div>
                  <p class="p-3 font-weight-bold">It's important that rabbits live with at least one other rabbit at all times, so that they feel safe. As they're social animals, they also enjoy eating together, grooming each other and lying down together to keep each other warm. 
                    
                    Living together will also make sure that they have companionship. Although rabbits can enjoy spending time with people, our company alone cannot meet a rabbit’s social needs. And rabbits are crepuscular (active at dawn, dusk and at certain periods during the night) so, even if you spend a lot of time with your rabbit, you will not be able to provide company all the time.</p>

                <!-- main section 2 -->
        <div class="d-flex flex-row mt-3 mr-5 ml-5">
            <div class="mov-l card w-75 mt-4 ml-5 text-center">
            <img class="card-img-center" src="/img/rabbit-4.jpg" alt="A rabbit">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h4 class="card-title bg-success text-white p-3 mt- font-italic">Bunnies love company and become lonely when they don't have companions of their own kind</h4>
            </div>
                <p class="p-3 font-weight-bold">These pets may come in domesticated colours and breeds, but their perspective on the world remains very close to that of their wild relatives. Because they're a prey species (they're hunted by other animals in the wild), life is all about survival and they are in a constant state of alert. This explains why many rabbits don’t like being picked up and may run away, hide, nip or bite if you try – your hands are not too dissimilar to the claws of a bird of predators swooping down to catch them.</p>
